# Library Application
COE528 Group project where we implemented a library application through JAVAFX to create a user interface. Applied concepts such as state design patterns and oriented object programming concepts through classes.

## What features does the library application have?
The library application allows owners to add, edit, and sell books to customers. Customers can only view the books, purchase them, and get rewarded based on their point status.
